# Millionaire game
The game on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire is a series of multiple-choice questions that each have four possible answers (A,B,C,D). The contestant must answer 10 of these questions correctly, one at a time, in order to win the million dollars. As soon as the contestant answers a question incorrectly, the game is over. You can customize the sequence of questions. Game results are stored in the section Results.
